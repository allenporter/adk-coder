# Agent Instructions for `adk-coder` Development

This document provides context and guidelines for agents working on the `adk-coder` codebase itself.

## Project Overview
`adk-coder` is a high-performance, terminal-based agentic development kit. It uses the **Textual** framework for its TUI and is designed to provide a "Gemini-like" interleaved conversation experience.

## Core Architectural Principles
1.  **Async-First**: All I/O-bound tools and TUI updates must be asynchronous. Use `asyncio.to_thread` for legacy synchronous library calls to avoid blocking the Textual main loop.
2.  **Interleaved UI**: The TUI (`adk_coder/tui.py`) uses a "Flow" model. Thoughts, tool calls, and results are appended dynamically to the conversation scroll area as they happen.
3.  **Graceful Degradation**: Tools should handle errors gracefully and return informative strings rather than crashing the agent loop.
4.  **Hierarchical Discovery**: Agents and skills are discovered by walking up the directory tree from the current working directory to the project root.

## Development Workflows
- **Scripts**: Always use the `./script/` directory for lifecycle tasks:
  - `./script/lint`: Format and lint code.
  - `./script/test`: Run the `pytest` suite.
  - `./script/bootstrap`: Install dependencies.
- **TUI Debugging**: Textual has a built-in console for debugging. Run with `textual console` in one terminal and `devtools=True` logic in the app.

## Coding Standards
- **Markup**: When sending text to the TUI that contains user or tool-generated content, ALWAYS use `rich.markup.escape()` to prevent `MarkupError`.
- **Typing**: Use static type hints throughout the project.
- **Imports**: Prefer top-level imports. The one exception is `tools.py` importing `build_adk_agent` from `agent_factory.py` — this must remain deferred to break a circular dependency (`tools ↔ agent_factory`).
- **Styling**: Maintain the Gemini-inspired aesthetic:
  - Agent prefix: `✦`
  - Thoughts: Italicized with a left border.
  - Tools: Compact, inline widgets with borders.

## Code Integrity & Safety
- **Atomicity**: When performing complex multi-file modifications, consider the impact of failure. Favor reversible changes.
- **Verification**: Always run `script/lint` and `script/test` after modifications to ensure no regressions were introduced.
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: If a task or codebase state is ambiguous during the Discovery phase, pause and ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- **Structured Edits**: Use specialized tools (like `edit_file` with exact matches) rather than overwriting whole files to minimize drift.

## Testing Conventions
- **Patch where it's used**: Always `patch("consumer_module.Name")`, not `patch("source_module.Name")`. For example, to mock `SqliteSessionService` used in `cli/sessions.py`, patch `adk_coder.cli.sessions.SqliteSessionService` — not `google.adk.sessions.sqlite_session_service.SqliteSessionService`. This ensures mocks work regardless of whether the consumer uses top-level or deferred imports.
